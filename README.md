MVVM    

Keeping its simple scope in mind I have implemented it with basic MVVM. But the architecture is scalable. 
If in future there is more complexity, we can add more layers as per clean architecture. These layers like UseCase, Reporitory etc can further help application to adhere to SOLID principals. Thus making sure clean coding practices are followed.
